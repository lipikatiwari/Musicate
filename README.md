# Musicate

'Musicate' is a startup project for music aficionados. The startup deals in midi controller keyboard with different utility packages for beginner and advanced users.
Through its aesthetic and interactive website, people can choose the most suitable package for them and start learning music.

The packages offer the users to brush up their piano skills, ear train themselves and to explore the production side of music.
The packages come in 2 types: Beginner and advanced
All the packages include a basic MIDI keyboard/controller.
MIDI: Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) 

Beginner: This package is most suited for users who want to learn piano and to get an idea about music theory. Using the MIDI keyboard provided and the virtual piano learning web application, the user can learn how to play songs on the piano. Through the interactive piano tutor, the user can practice the songs and learn basic music theory.

Advanced: This package caters to the users who have a basic music knowledge. Using our interactive music tutor and the MIDI keyboard, the user can now expand their music knowledge by ear training themselves and learning sheet music, For those who produce music, our MIDI keyboard can be used as a controller with Digital Audio Workstation to produce electronic music.

"A MIDI controller is any hardware or software that generates and transmits Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) data to electronic or digital MIDI-enabled devices to trigger sounds. MIDI controllers usually do not create or produce musical sounds by themselves. MIDI controllers typically have some type of interface which the performer presses, strikes, blows or touches. This action generates MIDI data which can then be transmitted to a MIDI-compatible sound module using a MIDI cable.
These come in all shapes and sizes, but MIDI keyboard controller which resembles a small piano is the most common."

The Chord Recognizer will be made using Python and Machine Learning. We will train the program to detect different chords. Using this training, the program will then try to detect the chords of any song. Expected accuracy 70%
For the MIDI controller and the touchless MIDI instrument, Arduino will be used. For the sound of the keyboard, chucK programming language will be used to produce sounds using simple sine waves.
The virtual piano will be made using javascript. The website will be made using full stack web development.
